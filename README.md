# Traffic Light Simulation

This Java application simulates a basic traffic light with red, yellow, and green lights. It uses Java's Swing library for the GUI.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command-line Java compiler
- VScode

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or navigate to the project directory in the terminal/command prompt.
3. Compile and run the `TrafficLightSimulation.java` file.

## Usage

- When the application starts, it automatically simulates the behavior of a traffic light.
- The lights cycle through red, red-yellow, green, and yellow states in sequence, simulating traffic signal changes.

## Customization

You can customize the simulation by adjusting the timing of light transitions in the `simulateTrafficLights()` method of `TrafficLightSimulation.java`. Modify the sleep times (in milliseconds) to change the duration of each light state.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to improve the simulation, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
